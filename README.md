# Javascript-Calculator

This JavaScript code creates a basic calculator. 

It defines several functions to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
The code then uses event listeners to listen for clicks on different buttons on the calculator (numbers, operators, clear, and equals). 
Depending on the button clicked, the code updates the current operand, previous operand, and operator displays, and performs the relevant mathematical operation. 
The code also includes a function to clear all displays and reset the running total when the clear button is clicked, and another function to perform the operation when the equals button is clicked.
